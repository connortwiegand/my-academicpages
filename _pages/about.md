I am a research economist from the University of Oregon. My research includes out-of-the-lab experiments which reveal longitudinal time preferences and strategic behavior in the presence of Artificial Intelligence. Broadly speaking, the labels "Experimental Economist", "Behavioral Economist", "Game Theorist", and *"Data Scientist"* would all be accurate descriptions of what I do. I'd like to consider myself at the intersection of extracting practical information from experimental data and modelling meaningful interaction using a modern tool case of microeconomic theory.  


* Born in the pacific northwest

* I have traveled all over: Spain, France, Italy, Jamaica, Barbados, Mexico, Canada...

* I earned a double major (B.S.) in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Washington
  -- Honor Roll, 3 years, Advanced Calculus Sequence + PhD courses

* While in high school, I participated in the [Running Start]() program, which allowed me to get my associates degree at the same time as I finished high school

* In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, playing games (board, video, you name it), and spending time with my wife.
